ayy yâ€™all this initial commit is a straight up port of Andrei's lil_waaaves but without MIDI or syphon. Also using the ofxGui addon. 
I'm using this as a starting point of working on the gui and modulation side, because starting from VW 2.5 was too much of a head ache.

Did not fuck with the code aside from removing syphon so everything is a little chunky. 
Going to progressively move into the newer code.
