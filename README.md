// ****  Update 6-6-22  ***

My quest has gone full circle back to ImGui... 
so now This really is just an update to lil_waaaves_sqrt-pi-
Going to have to do more research on json in OF to get that functional again but it seeems do able.

Going forward:
"Objectifying" the gui modules.
adding a geometry/titler module.

//***********************************************************

ayy yâ€™all this initial commit is a straight up port of Andrei's lil_waaaves but without MIDI or syphon. Also using the ofxGui addon. 
I'm using this as a starting point of working on the gui and modulation side, because starting from VW 2.5 was too much of a head ache.

Did not fuck with the code too much aside from removing syphon, so everything is a little chunky. 
I did get basic presets implimented. it's in the Gui side if you want to take a look.
Going to progressively move into the newer code.
